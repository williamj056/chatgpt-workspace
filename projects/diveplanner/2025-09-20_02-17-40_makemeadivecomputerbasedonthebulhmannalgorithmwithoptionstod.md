**Project:** DivePlanner

**Q:**
```
Make me a dive computer based on the Bulhmann algorithm with options to dial in how conservative I want to be, lets make it have all the basics of a dive computer but it could be used as a practice tool
```

**A:**

Creating a dive computer based on the BÃ¼hlmann algorithm with adjustable conservatism can be an exciting project! Below is a conceptual design for a dive computer that includes features commonly found in dive computers, while also providing functionality for practice and training. 

### Dive Computer Design Based on BÃ¼hlmann Algorithm

#### Basic Features

1. **User Interface:**
   - Display: LCD or OLED screen to show dive data clearly.
   - Buttons: At least three buttons for navigation and settings.
   - Menu System: Easy-to-navigate menu for settings, dive logs, and calculations.

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - Depth Sensor: To measure current depth (in meters or feet).
   - Time Clock: To track dive duration and surface intervals.
   - Temperature Sensor: To monitor water temperature.
   - Battery Monitoring: Indicator for battery life.
   - Logbook: Ability to store and review past dives.

3. **BÃ¼hlmann Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Predefined BÃ¼hlmann ZHL-16C model for calculating no-decompression limits (NDLs) based on depth and time.
   - Adjustable conservatism factor (e.g., 0-100% more conservative than the standard BÃ¼hlmann limits).

4. **Conservatism Settings:**
   - Slider or menu selection to adjust conservatism:
     - **Standard:** No adjustment, standard BÃ¼hlmann limits.
     - **Conservative:** Increase NDL by 10-30% (user-defined).
     - **Very Conservative:** Increase NDL by 30-50% (user-defined).
   - Display adjusted NDLs based on the selected conservatism.

5. **Dive Planning:**
   - Pre-dive planning feature that allows users to input target depth and time to see NDL and required surface intervals.
   - Option to simulate multiple dive profiles for training purposes.

6. **Safety Features:**
   - Ascent Rate Alarm: Warns if the diver exceeds a preset ascent rate (usually 9-18 meters/min).
   - Desaturation Time: Displays time required to safely ascend based on current nitrogen load.
   - Safety Stop Reminder: Alerts divers to perform a safety stop at 5 meters for 3 minutes.

7. **Practice Mode:**
   - Simulation mode: Allows divers to practice dive scenarios without entering water.
   - Variable conditions: Users can simulate different depths, times, and conservatism settings to see how it affects NDLs.
   - Challenges: Include timed exercises or quizzes related to dive safety and procedures.

8. **Connectivity:**
   - Bluetooth or USB: For downloading dive logs to a PC or mobile app.
   - App Integration: Companion app for further analysis, dive logging, and sharing with the diving community.

#### Additional Features

1. **User Profiles:**
   - Ability to create multiple profiles for different divers (e.g., experience levels, preferences).
  
2. **Recovery Mode:**
   - A feature that allows divers to input a "safety net" time for recovery after reaching maximum limits.

3. **Alerts and Notifications:**
   - Visual and audible alerts for depth limits, time limits, and ascent rates.
   
4. **Customization:**
   - Users can customize the display settings (e.g., backlight, font size) to suit their preferences.

### Summary

This dive computer design incorporates essential features along with the BÃ¼hlmann algorithm for dive planning and execution. The adjustable conservatism settings allow divers to tailor their experience to their comfort level, making it a valuable tool for both recreational and training purposes. The practice mode enhances learning opportunities, helping divers become more familiar with dive planning and safety protocols.

This conceptual design can be expanded further based on user feedback and technological advancements in sensors and materials. Ultimately, this dive computer could serve as a reliable companion for divers, promoting safety and enhancing skills in the water.
